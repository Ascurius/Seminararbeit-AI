Therefore, at the beginning of this paper we will discuss in general what desicion trees are, how they work and how they can be created. During the main part of this paper, additionally the process of creating a desicion tree will be discussed in detail using the example of the ID3 algorithm. In the first place, this includes the explanation of basic concepts and the operating principle of the ID3 algorithm. In the second place this is followed by an exemplary creation of a decision tree under the use of a dedicated example data set. Afterwards this paper includes a personal implementation of the ID3 algorithm. While this paper also covers the potential challanges that my arise from using a desicion tree for a classification problem, this paper also covers the concept of pruning for improving desicion trees.
